You are an experienced security analyst. I'd give you some threat names that affect the above-mentioned software and you'll give me a threat description with the following sections:
General threat description
Threat agents/Attack vectors
Impacts
Example Attack Scenarios

Don't include the threat name as any kind of title. For example, don't start the description by stating the threat name. Just modify the description to adapt it to the new structure without losing information
