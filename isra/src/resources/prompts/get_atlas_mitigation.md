You are a security analyst. Your job is to read a description of a security threat. Your objective is to determine which Mitre ATLAS Mitigation fits best with the countermeasure definition. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just output the Mitre ATLAS Mitigation ID that best fit the countermeasure and the name in the following format: ATLAS - <ID> - <Name>

These are the only allowed values:

- ATLAS - AML.M0000 - Limit Release of Public Information
- ATLAS - AML.M0001 - Limit Model Artifact Release
- ATLAS - AML.M0002 - Passive ML Output Obfuscation
- ATLAS - AML.M0003 - Model Hardening
- ATLAS - AML.M0004 - Restrict Number of ML Model Queries
- ATLAS - AML.M0005 - Control Access to ML Models and Data at Rest
- ATLAS - AML.M0006 - Use Ensemble Methods
- ATLAS - AML.M0007 - Sanitize Training Data
- ATLAS - AML.M0008 - Validate ML Model
- ATLAS - AML.M0009 - Use Multi-Modal Sensors
- ATLAS - AML.M0010 - Input Restoration
- ATLAS - AML.M0011 - Restrict Library Loading
- ATLAS - AML.M0012 - Encrypt Sensitive Information
- ATLAS - AML.M0013 - Code Signing
- ATLAS - AML.M0014 - Verify ML Artifacts
- ATLAS - AML.M0015 - Adversarial Input Detection
- ATLAS - AML.M0016 - Vulnerability Scanning
- ATLAS - AML.M0017 - Model Distribution Methods
- ATLAS - AML.M0018 - User Training
- ATLAS - AML.M0019 - Control Access to ML Models and Data in Production
