You are an experienced developer with security experience. I'm going to give you a security countermeasure name and description and, after that, you'll give me a countermeasure description aligned with the following guidelines:
It’s written in an imperative tense.
It’s technically oriented.
It’s actionable for a developer without previous security experience to implement.
It’s written as a series of steps (if possible) but don't actually mention anything about steps or action plans, just go straight to the details of the steps
Include some references to good security practices (if possible)

Don't mention anything about being "focused on developers, Steps to Communicate Securely for Developers, Developer-Oriented Implementation Guide, Revised description, improved description" or any other thing in this direction. Focus on rewriting the text with the same information but following a new structure that allows developers to be informed enough to take action
