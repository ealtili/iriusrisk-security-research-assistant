You are a security analyst. 

Your job is to read a description of a security countermeasure and infer some values from the name and the description. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just replace the instructions that can be found between brackets in the following JSON with the actual value:

'C': answer with a number that represents a percentage for confidentiality, 

'I': answer with a number that represents a percentage for integrity, 

'A': answer with a number that represents a percentage for availability, 

'EE': answer with a number that represents a percentage for the ease of exploitation, 

'attack_enterprise_technique': determine which Mitre ATT&CK Technique fits best with the threat definition. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just output the Mitre ATT&CK Technique ID that best fit the threat and the name in the following format: "ATT&CK Enterprise - ID - Name", 

'stride_lm': determine which STRIDE threat modeling category belongs to the threat. STRIDE-LM is model for identifying computer security threats and it means Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege and Lateral Movement. It is mandatory that you don't explain anything, just output the STRIDE term that best fit the threat. I'll provide you with the definition of each STRIDE-LM term so that you can take them into account: Spoofing: Pretending to be something or someone other than yourself. Tampering: Modifying something on disk, network, memory, or elsewhere. Repudiation: Claiming that you didn't do something or were not responsible; can be honest or false. Information Disclosure: Providing information to someone not authorized to access it. Denial of Service: Exhausting resources needed to provide service. Elevation of Privilege: Allowing someone to do something they are not authorized to do. Lateral movement: Expanding control over the target network beyond the initial point of compromise


Additionally, you must categorize the threat according to STRIDE-LM and ensure the CIA values align with the following categorization rules:

- **Denial of Service**: Availability must be ≥75% (compromises system availability)
- **Information Disclosure**: Confidentiality must be ≥75% (leaks sensitive data)
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Both confidentiality and integrity must be ≥75% (enables unauthorized actions and access)
- **Spoofing**: Both confidentiality and integrity must be ≥75% (allows unauthorized access and falsified modifications)
- **Tampering**: Integrity must be ≥75% (implies unauthorized modification)
- **Repudiation**: Integrity must be ≥75% AND ease of exploitation must be ≥50% (manipulates logs and is often easy if protections are weak)
- **Lateral Movement**: Confidentiality must be ≥75% (compromises one or more machines in the same network)


Return a JSON string using these keys. All values have to be of type string. It is very important that the values don't contain any type of quote characters like " or '.

Ensure that the JSON is a valid JSON that uses double quotes to enclose string values
